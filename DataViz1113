        "### Q&A\n",
        "The analysis addressed the following:\n",
        "*   **Significant trends or differences in commute mode shares for Bellevue:** Bellevue's 'Drive Alone' share consistently dominates (60-70%), while 'Public Transport' is stable at 5-10%. 'Carpool' shows a slight decline.\n",
        "*   **Comparison of commute mode shares across comparable cities:** In 2022, Seattle shows a significantly higher 'Public Transport' share (~15-20%) and lower 'Drive Alone' share (~50%) compared to Bellevue, Redmond, and Kirkland. Redmond has the highest 'Drive Alone' share (~70%).\n",
        "\n",
        "### Data Analysis Key Findings\n",
        "*   Historical commute mode share data for Bellevue, Redmond, Kirkland, and Seattle from 2018-2022 was successfully retrieved after initially correcting FIPS codes for Redmond (from 57395 to 57535) and Kirkland (from 37050 to 35940).\n",
        "*   The data was cleaned and standardized into a single DataFrame, `df_commute_data`, with appropriately named columns and numeric data types.\n",
        "*   Commute mode share percentages were accurately calculated for 'Drive Alone', 'Carpool', 'Public Transport', and 'Other Modes' for each city and year.\n",
        "*   **Bellevue Commute Trends (2018-2022):**\n",
        "    *   'Drive Alone' remains the dominant mode, consistently representing approximately 60% to 70% of commuters.\n",
        "    *   'Public Transport' share in Bellevue fluctuated between 5% and 10% over the period, showing some recovery in later years.\n",
        "    *   'Carpool' saw a slight decline in its share over these years.\n",
        "*   **Cross-Place Comparison (2022):**\n",
        "    *   **Drive Alone:** Redmond had the highest 'Drive Alone' share at approximately 70%, followed by Kirkland (around 65%), Bellevue (around 60%), and Seattle with the lowest at approximately 50%.\n",
        "    *   **Public Transport:** Seattle demonstrated a significantly higher 'Public Transport' usage, ranging from 15% to 20%, which is considerably higher than Bellevue (~8%), Kirkland (~5%), and Redmond (~5%).\n",
        "    *   **Carpool:** Carpooling shares were relatively low across all cities, generally in the 8-10% range.\n",
        "    *   **Other Modes:** Shares for 'Other Modes' were consistent across the cities, typically between 10% and 20%.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "*   Investigate factors contributing to Seattle's comparatively higher public transport ridership, which could inform urban planning and transit development strategies in Bellevue and other cities.\n",
        "*   Further analysis could explore the impact of specific events (e.g., COVID-19 pandemic) on commute mode shares, particularly on public transport and 'other modes', given the observed slight fluctuations.\n"

        "5. Consider the following options for deploying your Streamlit application online:\n",
        "    a. **Streamlit Community Cloud:** A free platform specifically designed for deploying Streamlit apps directly from a GitHub repository.\n",
        "    b. **Heroku:** A platform as a service (PaaS) that supports various programming languages, including Python, for deploying web applications.\n",
        "    c. **Google Cloud Platform (GCP) / Amazon Web Services (AWS) / Microsoft Azure:** Cloud providers offering virtual machines (e.g., EC2 on AWS, Compute Engine on GCP) or container services (e.g., ECS on AWS, Cloud Run on GCP) for more customized and scalable deployments.\n",
        "    d. **Docker:** Containerize your Streamlit app for consistent deployment across different environments, often used in conjunction with cloud platforms."

        "*   **Successful Streamlit Application Setup:** A `app.py` file was created and populated with all necessary data fetching and processing logic, including an API key, FIPS codes for 8 distinct locations (Bellevue, Redmond, Kirkland, Seattle, King County, Pierce County, Tacoma, Portland) across two states, and data for years ranging from 2018 to 2022. The data fetching function was cached using `@st.cache_data` for performance.\n",
        "*   **Interactive Data Filtering Implemented:** The Streamlit application now features interactive controls in a sidebar, allowing users to select specific locations, years, and commute modes (Drive Alone, Carpool, Public Transport, Other Modes) using `st.sidebar.multiselect` widgets.\n",
        "*   **Dynamic Visualizations Generated:** The application dynamically produces two Plotly visualizations:\n",
        "    *   A line chart displaying commute mode share trends over selected years and locations.\n",
        "    *   A grouped bar chart comparing commute mode shares for the latest selected year across selected locations.\n",
        "*   **Enhanced User Experience:** The application's layout was improved with clear titles (`Commute Mode Share Analysis`), descriptions, and subheaders for data preview and visualizations, ensuring an intuitive user interface.\n",
        "*   **Deployment Readiness:** Instructions were provided for local testing (`streamlit run app.py`) and a range of deployment options were outlined, including Streamlit Community Cloud, Heroku, major cloud providers (GCP, AWS, Azure), and Docker.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "*   The robust data fetching and processing pipeline, coupled with interactive visualizations, creates a powerful tool for exploring commute patterns. This structure allows for easy expansion to include more locations, years, or commute variables from the Census API.\n",
        "*   For future development, consider implementing user authentication for personalized dashboards or integrating advanced analytics features, such as predictive modeling, to forecast future commute trends.\n"
